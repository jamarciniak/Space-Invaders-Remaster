# Space-Invaders-Remaster
This is the remaster of The Space Invaders Game from my 2nd semester. 
The game is based of the popular Japanese game from 1978.

## Description 
The base of this project is the game I made on 2nd semester.
All of the textures and sounds used in this game are free licensed or free commercial licensed. Some of the textures were made by myself.

## Plans for the future
* Three difficulty levels ( based on a speed of the invaders movement and shooting frequency i think)
* Special events during the game, like flying asteroids
* Better scoring system
